Mininet 2.2.2 is primarily a performance improvement and bug fix release.

### Security Advisory!

* The Mininet VM images no longer ship with identical `ssh` keys. We recommend that you
  destroy any default `ssh` keys in existing Mininet VMs if you haven't already:

```
sudo rm -f /etc/ssh/*key*
sudo /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
sudo service ssh restart
```

### Improvements and Bug Fixes

* We now run [public CI builds via Travis](/blog/2017/01/12/testing-using-travis-ci/)
* Several common test failures have been addressed
* We use our own forked versions of `oflops` and the Stanford Reference
  Switch/Controller
* `install.sh` now has basic support for RHEL
* `mnexec` now works on systemd systems
* The default OpenFlow port is now the official port of 6653 rather
  than the classic port of 6633, which was nastily co-opted by Cisco.
* Several issues with the NAT element have been addressed

### Bugs and Gotchas

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) kernel bug: the problem resulting
  in `unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count
  = 1` in the console or kernel log has returned. We recommend using 14.04
  or an older kernel until this is fixed.
* Ryu installation with `install.sh -y` is still broken
* The `--tests` option is slightly different from mainline

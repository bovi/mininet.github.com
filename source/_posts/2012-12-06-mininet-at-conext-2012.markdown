We're going to France. No, really!

Join us next week, December 10th to 13th at
the [ACM Conference on Network EXperiments and Technologies, CoNEXT 2012](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2012/program.html),
where Brandon will be presenting our "runnable" paper on Mininet 2.0 "HiFi":

[_Reproducible Network Experiments using Container-Based Emulation_](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2012/eproceedings/conext/p253.pdf)

We look forward to meeting many current, new, and future Mininet users,
developers, researchers and contributors!

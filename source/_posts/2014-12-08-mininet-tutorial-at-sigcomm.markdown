### Objective

Sharing our experiences using the Mininet network
emulation platform to teach computer networking in a variety of
contexts ranging from small on-campus courses (Stanford, Georgia Tech,
MIT) to massive online courses. We believe that the Mininet platform
can make teaching and learning computer networking more fun and
effective by facilitating experiential learning.

### Program

* Introduce [Mininet](http://mininet.org) to the broader network community, including its capabilities and limitations and some example use cases.
* Familiarize attendees with Mininet through hands-on exercises.
* Share our experiences using Mininet since 2011 for on-campus and massive online courses at Stanford, Georgia Tech and MIT.
* Disseminate assignments that we used at our universities and help to develop and expand an online repository of Mininet courseware.

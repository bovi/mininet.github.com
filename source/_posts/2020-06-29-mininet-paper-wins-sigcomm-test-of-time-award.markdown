We are pleased to announce that our original HotNets paper,
[A Network in a Laptop: Rapid Prototyping for Software-Defined Networks](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2010/papers/a19-lantz.pdf), has won the
[ACM SIGCOMM Test of Time Paper Award](http://www.sigcomm.org/awards/test-of-time-paper-award).

Congratulations to the authors, Bob Lantz, Brandon Heller, and Nick
McKeown, and congratulations and thanks to the many researchers,
teachers, students, users, collaborators, and project contributors who
have used and continue to use Mininet to help usher in the SDN
revolution and improve the practice of computer networking!

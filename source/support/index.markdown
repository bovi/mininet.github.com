Mininet is self-supported by the friendly Mininet community via the `mininet-discuss` mailing list and the [FAQ](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/FAQ). To sign up for the mailing list, go to <https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/mininet-discuss>.

We hope to preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio for the mailing list, so please try to submit only intelligent, well-researched questions or comments regarding Mininet itself (rather than OpenFlow, NOX, networking in general, etc.) and high-quality answers. Your questions are much more likely to be answered (and you're likely to have much more success) if you're using our pre-built virtual machine (VM) image.

Please do consult the [documentation](/docs) and [FAQ](/faq) before posting questions to `mininet-discuss`,
and please feel free to answer questions posted on the list!

You are also encouraged to contribute helpful questions and answers to the [FAQ](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/FAQ).

Please also feel free to make use of the `#mininet` IRC channel on [FreeNode](http://freenode.net) for Mininet-related discussion. For OpenFlow discussion, please feel free to use `#openflow` (and people on `#openflow` might also be able to help with Mininet issues.)

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
---------------------------------

Please file any Mininet **bug reports** and **feature requests** (only!) by creating a new issue on [github](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/issues). Please read and use the **[issue template](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)**.

Please *do not* abuse github issues by posting random questions or requests for support. Please do consult the
[documentation](/docs) and [FAQ](/faq) before posting questions to `mininet-discuss`.


Mininet is an Open Source project, so we encourage everyone to work to improve it! Please feel free to submit patches and pull requests along with your issue.

If you are working on a new feature, please **create an issue** for the feature you're working on so that we can all avoid duplicating effort. When your new feature (or fix) is ready, submit a pull request and/or attach a patch to your issue.


Community Packages and Extensions
---------------------------------

In addition to the core Mininet system, several members of the Mininet community have developed useful [Mininet-based packages, extensions, and tools](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Mininet-Community-Extensions-and-Packages).

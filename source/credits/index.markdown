Mininet is under active development, and we hope it will become a
highly useful and flexible virtual network platform for research,
experimentation, debugging, learning, and many other
applications. Most importantly, it's an easy and fun way to experiment
with OpenFlow, P4, and SDN!

Mininet is an open source effort, and we encourage submission of
patches that fix bugs or add useful features. If you would like to
create or submit a patch, please open an issue and/or a pull request
on github. Please also feel free to drop us a line on mininet-discuss.

Thanks to ONF, Stanford, FAUCET/Google, University of Arizona, and any
other organizations or employers that have supported the Mininet
effort financially or otherwise.

Thanks to Tomasz Buchert and Santiago Ruano Rinc√≥n for Debian packaging.

Thanks to James Page for helping to make Ubuntu packages a reality,

Mininet 1.0 was created by Bob Lantz and Brandon Heller, based on
the original Mininet prototype demonstrated by Bob Lantz.

Mininet's process-based virtualization approach uses Linux network
namespaces, which were developed by Eric Biederman.
